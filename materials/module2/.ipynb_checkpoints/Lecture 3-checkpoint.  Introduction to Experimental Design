    "3. Specify the variables to measure. \n",
    "4. Determine if we will use the entire population or a sample. \n",
    "5. If we are going to sample, then we need to choose the sample type. \n",
    "6. Address ethical concerns. For example consider data privacy.\n",
    "7. Collect the data. \n",

    "\n",
    "For example, it is commonly known that the more education a person has, the higher the income level that person enjoys.  However, people with the same education level may not make the same level of income.   Ethnicity and gender can also play a role in the income level.

    "For example, a study on why African Americans and women were making less money than their male and caucasian counterparts, the reasons were not explained by the fact that fewer subjects obtained degrees or were employed, but by the fact that there existed a persistent strain of both racism and sexism in the American job and educational marketplace. \n",
