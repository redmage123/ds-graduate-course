    "## What is statistics?\n",
    "Statistics is the studyt of how to collect, organize, analyze and interpret numerical information and data. \n",
    "\n",
    "While this sounds somewhat complex, people use statistics constantly.  For example, if we want to find a good restaurant, we may go to a restaurant review site.  Reviews for a particular restaurant may vary wildly, so how do we determine whether or not we should eat at this particular establishment? \n",
    "\n",
    "This uncertainty about the data is why we need statistics.\n",
    "Statistics is both about the science of uncertainty and being able to extract relevant information from the raw data available.  (In the case of our previous example, all of the reviews for the restaurant in question). \n",
    "\n",
    "Statistics are used constantly to help people make important decisions in many different fields of endeavor, from healthcare to business to government policy.  \n",
